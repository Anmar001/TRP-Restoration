This repository contains the AMPL model and data files for the paper: 

"Temporary Measures For Distribution Network Restoration After Natural Disasters"

## Overview

A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for post-disaster distribution system restoration that jointly optimizes: 
- Repair sequencing and crew routing
- Temporary line construction
- Portable generator deployment
- Portable substation placement
- Network reconfiguration

## Files

- `Temp_Measures_Restoration.mod` - AMPL model file containing the MILP formulation
- `Temp_Measures_Base_Data.dat` - AMPL data file for the IEEE 123-bus test system
